Welcome to [MeYouBlog](http://www.meyoublog.com/)
====================

>MeYouBlog is an open source blog powered by Flask and MongoDB, modified from [OctBlog](https://github.com/flyhigher139/OctBlog) by MeYou.
Based on OctBlog, I customized templates style in my favor and also added some plugins in the blog (like adding editor.md and supporting uploading from  the local image files), will add more features in the future.
here are some instructions on how to run it.

### 1:How to power it?

Install requirements

```bash
(sudo) pip install -r requirements.txt

#install mongodb and check it out
sudo apt-get install mongodb
ps aux|grep mongodb
```


### 2:Run  MeYouBlog

Run MeYouBlog with this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huangtao00/MeYouBlog.git
cd MeyouBlog/app
python manage.py runserver

```
or like this:(debug html,css,js file using livereload)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/huangtao00/MeYouBlog.git
cd MeyouBlog/app
python manage.py live
```

Then you can visit the blog with url: `http://127.0.0.1:5000` or `http://127.0.0.1:5500` (if livereload)

You can change settings in `app/OctBlog/config.py` file if you want.
