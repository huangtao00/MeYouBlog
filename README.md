 [meyou`s blog](http://www.meyoublog.com),[OctBlog](https://github.com/flyhigher139/OctBlog) is almost the same with [MayBlog](https://github.com/flyhigher139/MayBlog) except that it is powered by [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) rather than [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and SQL Databases.

And as my customary, I named it OctBlog as OctBlog was started in October, 2015

OctBlog offers every function in MayBlog, and aims to do it better, its features are as follow:

- Multiple user
- OctBlog roles: su, admin, editor, writer, reader
- Blog features: posts, pages, tags, and categories
- Markdown support
- Admin interface
- Change configurations by configuration file or environment variable
- Multiple comment plugin
- User defined widgets
- Deploy with docker
- Sort posts by weight

## Demo

[Gevin's Blog](https://blog.igevin.info/) is powered by OctBlog

## Explanation

The weight is used to order articles, and if you want to hidden an article from the article list, weight is also qualified:

The default weight for each article is 10, if a article's weight is heavier than 10, it will be firstly displayed, and if the weight is negative, the article will be never displayed in the article list
